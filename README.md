# Face Recognition Attendance System
**Overview**

This project implements a face recognition-based attendance system that automates the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces in real-time. The system leverages the Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) algorithm for face recognition, ensuring accurate and efficient identification of individuals.

**Features**

1. Real-time face detection and recognition
2. Automatic attendance marking
3. User-friendly web interface
4. Attendance history and report generation
5. Supports multiple users
6. Utilizes the LBPH algorithm for robust face recognition
